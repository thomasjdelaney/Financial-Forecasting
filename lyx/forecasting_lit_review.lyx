\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An overview of forecasting methods, from the simplest to the most up to date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is Forecasting?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\shape italic
time series
\shape default
 is list of measurements or recordings ordered by the time at which those measurements were taken, or those recordings were made. 
\shape italic
Forecasting
\shape default
 is the act of predicting the future value of a quantity (usually a time series) with some measure of confidence. Every forecasting method consists of constructing a model of the series, and basing a mean prediction and prediction interval on that model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example: The Naïve Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:naive_method"

\end_inset

 For example, one of the simplest forecasting methods is the 
\shape italic
naïve
\shape default
 method. This consists of forecasting that the next value of the time series will be sampled from a normal distribution (aka. Gaussian distribution) with mean equal to the latest value of the time series, and standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the one step changes in the time series. Using this model, the forecasted value for the time series is same as the latest value, and the prediction intervals are calculated using the z-distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More formally, if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_1, \dots, y_T \in \mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a time series and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_1, \dots, d_{T-1}$
\end_inset

 are the one step differences of that series, then according to the naïve model 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}\label{eq:naive_method}
	\hat{y}_{T+1 | 1, \dots, T} \sim \mathcal{N}(y_T, \sigma^2)
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^2$
\end_inset

 is the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $d_1, \dots, d_{T-1}$
\end_inset

. As for prediction intervals, since the z-statistic for 
\begin_inset Formula $95\%$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1.96$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $95\%$
\end_inset

 prediction interval for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}_{T+1 | 1, \dots, T}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1.96\sigma$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Residuals, Normality& Prediction Intervals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a forecasting context, a residual is the difference between a given time series value and the one step forecast for that value, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_t = y_t - \hat{y}_{t | 1, \dots , t-1}$
\end_inset

. Given some forecasting model,these residuals are usually used to determine the amount of noise in the model and calculate the prediction intervals. It should be noted that since the z-distribution is always used to calculate the prediction intervals, the residuals of the model must be distributed normally. Otherwise the intervals will be inaccurate. Effectively, the noise in any model is always modelled as white noise, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}\label{eq:white_noise}
	\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^2$
\end_inset

 is the variance of the residuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example given in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:naive_method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, since the model forecasts the next value in the series to be the same as the last, the residuals are the one step differences of the series. Another way of formulating the model given by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:naive_method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+1 | 1, \dots, T} = y_T + \epsilon_t
\end{align}
\end_inset


\end_layout

Random Walk Forecasting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
% consider putting random walk in with ETS and ARIMA altogether
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Random walk is another simple method for forecasting in which the one step change in the time series is modelled. The simplest version models the one step change as a normal distribution with zero mean. This is the same as the naïve model in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:naive_method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

. The model can be expanded to include a 
\shape italic
drift
\shape default
 term so that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+1|1, \dots, T} - y_T \sim \mathcal{N}(c, \sigma^2)
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c \in \mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^2$
\end_inset

 is the variance of the residuals. If 
\begin_inset Formula $c > 0$
\end_inset

 then the series will show an upward linear trend, and if 
\begin_inset Formula $c<0$
\end_inset

 the series will show a downward linear trend. Another way of formulating this model is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+1|1, \dots, T} = y_T + c + \epsilon_t
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_t$
\end_inset

 is defined by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:white_noise"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, as usual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Seasonally Adjusted Random Walk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A random walk model can be used to forecast time series with a seasonal pattern. If there are 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 seasons, that is, if the seasonality has a period of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 time-steps then the forecasted value will be based on the value of the previous season, rather than the previous time step 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+1|1, \dots, T}  - y_{T+1-m} \sim \mathcal{N}(c,\sigma^2) \hspace{5mm} \text{or} \hspace{5mm} \hat{y}_{T+1|1, \dots, T} =  y_{T+1-m} + c + \epsilon_t
\end{align}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These random walk models are sometimes called 
\shape italic
difference models
\shape default
 because the forecast is based upon the difference between previous values of the series, with some lag applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transformations for Stationarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed, or more precisely if 
\begin_inset Formula $\{y_t\}$
\end_inset

 is a stationary time series, then for all 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $(y_t, \dots ,y_{t+s})$
\end_inset

 does not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

. A white noise time series (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:white_noise"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) is an example of a stationary series. The aim of most simple forecasting models is to capture all the variance of a time series, except for some additional or multiplicative white noise. This means that the model will often consist of applying transformations to the time series until the series is stationary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the naïve model captures the amplitude or 
\shape italic
level
\shape default
 of the time series by taking the one step difference, leaving only white noise thereafter. A seasonal random walk model with a non-zero drift parameter will capture the amplitude of the time series at each season, and the overall trend of the time series, leaving only white noise thereafter. Some non-linear trends can be captured using a Box-Cox transformation. 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	y_{t, (\lambda)} = \begin{cases}
					\frac{y_t^\lambda - 1}{\lambda} &\quad \text{if } \lambda \neq 0 \\
					\ln(y_t) &\quad \text{if } \lambda = 0 
				\end{cases}
\end{align}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If multiplicative noise is observed in the time series, it's common to apply a log transformation in order to the make the noise additive, or a Box-Cox transformation with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda = 0$
\end_inset

. In the case where the time series may take values less than or equal to zero, the Yeo-Johnson transforamtion is used to capture non-linearity, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	y_{t, (\lambda)} = \begin{cases}
					\frac{(y_t + 1)^\lambda - 1}{\lambda} &\quad \text{if } \lambda \neq 0, y_t \geq 0 \\
					\ln(y_t + 1) &\quad \text{if } \lambda = 0, y_t \geq 0 \\
					-\frac{[(-y_t + 1)^{2-\lambda}-1]}{2-\lambda} &\quad \text{if } \lambda \neq 2, y_t < 0 \\
					-\ln(-y_t + 1) &\quad \text{if } \lambda = 2, y_t < 0
				\end{cases}
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $0 \leq \lambda \leq 2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
ARIMA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Auto-regression models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Auto-regression models are exactly what they sound like. They use a linear combination of some of the previous elements of the time series to forecast the upcoming values. The number of values used is determined by the 
\shape italic
degree
\shape default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

. A degree-
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 auto-regressive model can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}\label{eq:ar_model}
	\hat{y}_{T|1, \dots, T-1} = c + \phi_1 y_{T-1} + \phi_2 y_{T-2} + \cdots + \phi_p y_{T-p} + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_t$
\end_inset

 is the usual white noise. A model of this kind of often denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(p)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 term can capture a linear trend in the series. An 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(1)$
\end_inset

 model with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_1 = 1$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to a random walk with a trend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for the modelled series to be stationary some restrictions must be applied to the parameter values. Specifically, for an 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(p)$
\end_inset

 model the roots of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	z^p - \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_{i}z^{p-i}
\end{align}
\end_inset

must lie within the complex unit circle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\modu{z_i} < 1$
\end_inset

. Practically, this amounts to having 
\begin_inset Formula $\modu{\phi_1}<1$
\end_inset

 for an 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(1)$
\end_inset

 model, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\modu{\phi_2}<1$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_1 + \phi_2 <1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(2)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most suitable order for an 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(p)$
\end_inset

 model can be determined by looking at the 
\begin_inset Formula $ACF$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $PACF$
\end_inset

 of the time series. The lag beyond which the 
\begin_inset Formula $PACF$
\end_inset

 appears to be zero is the most suitable order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Moving-average models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Moving average model
\shape default
 is a poor name for this model, but it is the conventional name. A better name would be 
\shape italic
residual-regression model
\shape default
 because the forecast is a linear combination of past residuals. A moving average model or order q can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	\hat{y}_{T|1, \dots, T-1} = c + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \cdots + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q}
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_t$
\end_inset

 is the usual white noise. This type of model is usually denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $MA(q)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a moving average model can be expressed as an infinite degree AR model, the moving average model is called 
\shape italic
invertible
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
ARIMA models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Auto-regression, difference, and moving average models can be combined. A combination of an 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(p)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-step difference, and 
\begin_inset Formula $MA(q)$
\end_inset

 model is denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $ARIMA(p,d,q)$
\end_inset

. 
\begin_inset Formula $ARIMA$
\end_inset

 stands for 
\shape italic
Auto-regressive integrated moving average
\shape default
. To construct an 
\begin_inset Formula $ARIMA(p,d,q)$
\end_inset

 model, first 
\begin_inset Formula $\{y_t\}$
\end_inset

 is transformed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ y_t^{\prime} \}$
\end_inset

 by taking the 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-step difference, then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
	\hat{y}_{T|1,\dots,T-1}^{\prime} = c + \phi_1 y_{T-1}^{\prime} + \cdots + \phi_{p} y_{T-p}^{\prime} + \epsilon_t + \theta_{1} \epsilon_{t-1} + \cdots + \theta_{q} \epsilon_{t-q}
\end{equation}
\end_inset

The degree of the 
\begin_inset Formula $AR$
\end_inset

 and the order of the 
\begin_inset Formula $MA$
\end_inset

 that should be used can be determined from a combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $ACF$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $PACF$
\end_inset

. The number of differences to use is generally two or fewer. This can be determined by examining the long term trend of the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Seasonal ARIMA models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to capture seasonal behaviour in the time series, a 
\shape italic
seasonal ARIMA
\shape default
 model can be used. This is an additional 
\begin_inset Formula $ARIMA$
\end_inset

 model where all the lags are the length of one season. The length of a season will have to be found by inspection. The additional seasonal 
\begin_inset Formula $ARIMA$
\end_inset

 terms are just multiplied by the standard 
\begin_inset Formula $ARIMA$
\end_inset

 terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Error, Trend, Smoothing models (ETS models)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simple Exponential Smoothing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a time series has no clear trend, seasonality, or cycle but appears to vary around some fixed amplitude, simple exponential smoothing might be a suitable forecasting method. In simple exponential smoothing, the forecast is an weighted sum of the series's previous values where the weights decrease exponentially going backwards in time. 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+1 | T,\dots,1} = \alpha y_T + \alpha(1-\alpha)y_{T-1} + \alpha(1-\alpha)^2y_{T-2} + \cdots
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$
\end_inset

 is the smoothing parameter. If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, a large weight will be given to values in the distant past. If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, more recent values will get a larger weight, which usually makes sense. In the extreme case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha = 1$
\end_inset

 the forecast will be same as the mean forecast of the naïve method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basically just decompose the time series into level, trend, and seasonal components. The seasonal component can be multiplicative or additive. Simple exponential smooting is usually written in one of two ways. The weighted average form is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+1|T,\dots,1} = \alpha y_T + \left(  1 - \alpha \right)\hat{y}_{T|T-1,\dots,1}
\end{align}
\end_inset

Note that the second term on the right hand side is a forecasted value, and therefore accounts for all the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y_t \right\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $t < T$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The component form is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+1|T,\dots,1} &= \ell_T \label{eq:ses_forecast}\\
	\ell_T &= \alpha y_T	+ (1 - \alpha)\ell_{T-1} \label{eq:ses_smoothing}
\end{align}
\end_inset

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ses_forecast"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is called the 
\shape italic
forecast equation
\shape default
, and equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ses_smoothing"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is called the 
\shape italic
smoothing equation
\shape default
 or the 
\shape italic
level equation
\shape default
. The practicality of the component form will be clearer when trend and seasonal components are introduced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When implementing exponential smoothing, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_0$
\end_inset

 are parameters that must be fitted. The usual way of fitting the parameters is by minimising the sum of the squared errors between the timer series and the fitted values, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	SSE =  \sum_{t=1}^T\left( y_t - \hat{y}_{t|t-1} \right)^2
\end{align}
\end_inset

This is a non-linear optimisation problem for which there is no analytical solution, so an optimisation algorithm must be used. Usually this will be built into whatever programming language is used for implementation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Holt's Linear Trend Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simple exponential smooting can be extended to time series with a trend by including another smoothing equation. 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+h|T,\dots,1} &= \ell_T + hb_T \label{eq:holt_forecast}\\
	\ell_T &= \alpha y_T + (1 - \alpha)\left(\ell_{T-1} + b_{T-1}\right) \label{eq:holt_level} \\
	b_T &= \beta^*\left( \ell_t - \ell_{t-1} \right) + (1 - \beta^*)b_{T-1} \label{eq:holt_trend}
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $0 \leq \beta^* \leq 1$
\end_inset

. Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holt_forecast"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holt_level"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 are the forecast and level equations as before. Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:holt_trend"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is called the 
\shape italic
trend equation
\shape default
. The trend for a given timestep is a weighted sum of the change in the level beteen this time-step and the last time-step, and the previous trend. The level equation is influenced by the trend of the previous step. The forecast equation has a trending component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Holt's linear method will give a forecast that is linear in the forecast horizon. A slightly better approach is to used the damped version. 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{T+h|T,\dots,1} &= \ell_T + \left( \phi + \phi^2 + \cdots + \phi^h \right)b_T \label{eq:holt_forecast}\\
	\ell_T &= \alpha y_T	+ (1 - \alpha)\left(\ell_{T-1} + \phi b_{T-1}\right) \label{eq:holt_level} \\
	b_T &= \beta^*\left( \ell_t - \ell_{t-1} \right) + (1 - \beta^*)\phi b_{T-1} \label{eq:holt_trend}
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $0 < \phi < 1$

\begin_layout Section
Modelling the Volatility: ARCH, GARCH
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until this section, all of the models mentioned in this document have noise with a constant variance. The models in this section are used for modelling the variance in the noise. ARCH stands for auto-regressive conditional heteroskedasticity. The `skedasticity' part of the heteroskedasticity comes from the Greek 
\shape italic
skedastikos
\shape default
, meaning `able to disperse'. A 
\shape italic
homoskedastic
\shape default
 variable is dispersed by the same amount all the time, i.e. with constant variance, whereas a 
\shape italic
heteroskedastic
\shape default
 variable has a variance that changes over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An ARCH model models the variance of the noise as an auto-regressive variable. If 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_t$
\end_inset

 is the noise of the model, say 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\epsilon_t = \sigma_t z_t
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
\end_inset

 is white noise, and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\sigma^2_t = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^q \alpha_i \epsilon_{t-i}^2
\end{align}
\end_inset

is an 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(q)$
\end_inset

 model for the variance of the noise. When an 
\begin_inset Formula $AR(q)$
\end_inset

 model is used to model the volatility of a time series, the volatility at any given time step will be correlated with the previous steps. If the volatility is modelled using white noise, the volatility will be uncorrelated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an 
\begin_inset Formula $ARMA(q,p)$
\end_inset

 is used to model the volatility, this is called a generalised auto-regressive conditional heteroskedasticity model, or GARCH model. In this case 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\sigma^2_t = \omega + \sum_{i=1}^q \alpha_i \epsilon_{t-i}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i \sigma^2_{t-i}
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega = \alpha_0 + \beta_0$
\end_inset

. Introducing the moving average model part allows the model to quickly respond to sudden changes in the volatility. The auto-regressive part then propagates these changes forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula $ARCH(q)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $GARCH(q,p)$
\end_inset

 models are popular in financial forecasting since the volatility is rarely white noise, and forecasting volatility accurately can be profitable. The 
\begin_inset Formula $GARCH(1,1)$
\end_inset

 model is most popular in this context.

Ensemble Methods

\begin_layout Section
Meta-learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meta-learning in forecasting refers to the process of learning which of a collection of forecasting methods is most suitable to use in a given situation, or learning how to combine a collection of methods into an ensemble approach. When building a meta-learning framework, there are three distinct steps that are usually necessary. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Building the Meta-learning Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Augmenting the Dataset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adding to the dataset with simulated time series. In order to take the machine learning approaches necessary in meta-learning, a large and balanced time series dataset is required. Therefore it can be necessary to augment whole the dataset, or augment specific subsets of the dataset in order have an equal number of examples of each type of time series. When simulating time series, care should be taken to create series which have similar characteristics to the observed time series. Time series can be simulated using pre-defined functions in 
\family typewriter
R
\family default
 such as 
\family typewriter
auto.arima
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
ets
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional time series can also be created by bootstrapping, that is sampling chunks from existing time series. When deciding what size the sampled chunks should be, the period of the data's cycles and seasonality must be taken into account. If the bootstrapped data will be used to train an RNN that uses LSTMs or GRUs, any long term dependencies must be taken into account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Feature Extraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:features"

\end_inset

 Feature extraction. In order to train the meta-learning model, features must be extracted from each of the time series and included in the training set along with the time series itself. Examples of features used by meta-learning models are: first autocorrelation coefficient, first autocorrelation coefficient of the first differenced series, first autocorrelation of the twice-differenced series, spectral entropy, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 parameter of an 
\begin_inset Formula $ets(A,A,N)$
\end_inset

 model, 
\shape italic
lumpiness
\shape default
, seasonal period, trend strength from an STL decomposition, series length, etc., etc. It is normal to extract dozens of different features from each time series. The time series combined with the features extracted from that series make up one training example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step to training the model is to apply each of the forecasting methods to each time series. Then to measure the accuracy of each forecast. Then to choose a loss function for the meta-learning model, the minimisation of which will minimise the forecasting error of the meta-learning model. Then to use some optimisation algorithm to find the meta-learning parameters that minimise the loss function. In the case where the model combines the collection of forecasting methods, another simpler model will be required to calculate prediction intervals, and that model must be trained in a similar way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using the Meta-learning Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building the meta-learning model is usually done offline before the model is used to forecast new time series. This means that as long as the time taken to train the model is reasonable (less than two days for example) this time can be disregarded, and forecasts can be obtained very quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to obtain a forecast from the meta-learning model, the features mentioned in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:features"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 are extracted. Then the features and the time series itself are fed in to the model, and the model will return a forecast and prediction intervals. It's

They extracted thirty-three different features from each time series. They trained a different classifier for yearly, quarterly, and monthly data from the M1 and M3 competitions. The FFORMS model consistently ranks in the top most accurate forecasting methods for forecasting both the M1 and the M3 series and most often ranks as the most accurate method.

\begin_layout Standard
Montero-Manso et al (2018) trained a gradient boosted tree model to learn the weights for a weighted ensemble of simple forecasting methods, and entered their model in the M4 forecasting competition. They used the M4 competition dataset. No augmentation was necessary. While training the model they performed a search over the hyper-parameter space of the gradient boosted tree model, using cross-validation to find the best hyper-parameters. They extracted forty-two features from each of the time series in training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the model for any new time series, the features are extracted and the forecasts of the simple methods are calculated. The model then takes the time series and the features and outputs a vector of real numbers the same length as the number of forecasting methods. These numbers are transformed into probabilities using a softmax function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\shape italic
softmax
\shape default
 function is a squashing function which can take an arbitrary vector of real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
\end_inset

 and transform it into a vector of values between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 that sum to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

. Formally, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\sigma : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow& \left\{ \sigma(\mathbf{x}) \in \mathbb{R}^n : \sigma(\mathbf{x})_j > 0 \forall j, \sum_{j=1}^n \sigma(\mathbf{x})_j = 1 \right\} \\
	\sigma(\mathbf{x})_i &= \frac{e^{\mathbf{x}_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\mathbf{x}_j}}
\end{align}
\end_inset

The softmax function is used in multi-class classification where a linear regression model is passed through a softmax function to give categorical probabilities. In this case there is one probability for each of the forecasting methods. These probabilities are used to combine the forecasts linearly in order to produce a single forecast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to calculate prediction intervals, the model calculates the prediction intervals radius of a subset of the forecasting methods. A subset is taken for computational cost reasons. These radii are combined linearly using a weight matrix which is learned in training to give an upper and lower value for the interval for each time step in the forecasting horizon.

		&= \sum_{n=1}^N P(X = x_n) \log \frac{1}{P(X=x_n)}
\end{align}
\end_inset

The entropy of a continuous random variable is defined similary, but with integrals instead of summations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the variable is uniformly distributed across its values, then its entropy is maximised. If 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

 only ever takes one of its possible values, then 
\begin_inset Formula $H(X)=0$

s are the inputs, for example a given time series. The 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

s are the activation values. The

s are the outputs. In this example network, the activations and outputs are defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}

	&= f(W_{a}[a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}] + b_a) \\
	y^{\langle t \rangle} &= g(W_{ya}a^{\langle t \rangle} + b_y)

\begin_inset Formula $f$

\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 could be used as part of the input to step 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 for example, or there could be connections that skip over one or more time steps, or outputs may not be produced until after all the inputs have been processed. The activation functions need not be just one function, there could be several functions connected to make up a smaller network which gives the activation function.

Approximates the identity function near the origin
\end_layout

\end_inset

 If the activity function looks like the identity function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x) = x$
\end_inset

 near the origin, then the network will learn efficiently when the paramters are initialised to small values. So this gives a good starting point for optimisation. If 
\begin_inset Formula $f(0) = 0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(0) = 1$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is continuous around 0, then it's fair to say that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 approximates the identity around the origin. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The range or codomain of the function will have an effect on the network also. If the range of the function is restricted to some interval then gradient descent optimisation methods tend to be stable as the value of the gradient is very small for most values. On the other hand, the training process will suffer from the vanishing gradient problem causing learning to slow down as training goes on. 
\begin_inset Formula $\tanh$
\end_inset

 and the sigmoid function are examples of activation functions with ranges restricted to an interval. If the range of the function is unrestricted, training tends to be more efficient as the gradient of the activation function doesn't disappear, but a smaller learning rate may be necessary to find the optimum. The rectified linear unit and any other activation fuctions like that have unrestricted ranges.

\begin_layout Standard
The backpropagation algorithm is used to train RNNs, just like any neural network. If the gradient of the loss function is propagated back through all of the time steps in the input sequence, the gradient may become exponentially small, or exponentially large. This is called the vanishing gradient problem, or exploding gradient problem, respectively. A vanishing gradient will make it difficult for information or errors (and error correction) to propagate along the RNN and will inhibit learning over time. An exploding gradient will make learning impossible as the gradient becomes too large to compute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vanishing gradient problem is more common in RNNs, and the exploding gradient problem is easier to deal with. Therefore, many of the innovations in RNNs are attempts to solve the vanishing gradient problem. The most well known and widely used of these is the 
\shape italic
long-short term memory unit
\shape default
, or LSTM (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

). There have been some innovations on the LSTM idea. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the Just Another Net (JANET) will be covered here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LSTM, GRU, and JANET are examples of `cells' or `neurons' that can be stacked and connected in order to build the RNN. There have also been innovations in the way the RNNs are connected, i.e. the

 Each of the neurons in the RNN can take the form of an LTSM. So the LSTM will take an input 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\langle t \rangle}$
\end_inset

 and an activation 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}$
\end_inset

 from the previous time step, and will output an activation. The activation could then be used to create an output for the RNN. The LSTM is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\tilde{c}^{\langle t \rangle} &= \tanh(W_c[a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}] + b_c) \label{eq:lstm_cand} \\
	\Gamma_u &= \sigma(W_u[a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}] + b_u) \label{eq:lstm_update} \\
	\Gamma_f &= \sigma(W_f[a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}] + b_f) \label{eq:lstm_forget} \\
	\Gamma_o &= \sigma(W_o[a^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}] + b_o) \label{eq:lstm_output} \\
	c^{\langle t \rangle} &= \Gamma_u \odot \tilde{c}^{\langle t \rangle} + \Gamma_f \odot c^{\langle t-1 \rangle} \label{eq:lstm_cell} \\
	a^{\langle t \rangle} &= \Gamma_o \odot \tanh( c^{\langle t \rangle}) \label{eq:lstm_act}
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\odot$
\end_inset

 represents element-wise multiplication and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 represents the sigmoid function. The 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\langle t \rangle}$
\end_inset

 quantity can be interpreted as an internal value for the LSTM. The LSTM is sometimes referred to as a `cell', so the letter `c' is used. The 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{c}^{\langle t \rangle}$
\end_inset

 quantity can be interpreted as a candidate for the updated internal value which is calculated using the current input 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\langle t \rangle}$
\end_inset

 control the update to the internal value of the cell. The updated internal value 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\langle t \rangle}$
\end_inset

 will be a combination of the candidate update and the previous internal value 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\langle t-1 \rangle}$
\end_inset

. The activation of the unit

 defines a state within the cell that may not be affected by incoming inputs and activations depending on the update and forget gates. Since the update and forget gates are defined using the sigmoid function, these gates must be between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

. Furthermore, the value of these gates is likely to be pushed towards 0 or 1 by the back propagation process. So, these gates can be intuitively interpreted as a vector of binary values of the same length as the input. Therefore the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $W_u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_f$
\end_inset

 should allow the RNN to learn when the value of a certain input or activation will have an effect on an output much later on in the input time series. This is the `memory' referred to in the title of the LSTM.

\begin_layout Standard
The GRU can be seen as a simplification of the LSTM because it avoids the vanishing gradient function in the same way as the LSTM, but using fewer equations and fewer parameters. Similar to the LSTM, the GRU uses an internal value or `state' which might be updated slightly or updated a lot at every time step. But the GRU uses this state as its activation, so there is no need for an output gate. The GRU also disregards the forget gate, and uses a single update gate to decide by how much the internal state will be updated. The only addition to the LSTM in the GRU is a 
\shape italic

\begin_layout Standard
The JANET is another simplification of the standard LSTM. Van der Westhuizen et al (2018) removed the update and output gates from the LSTM, leaving only the forget gate. They also subtracted a constant from the argument for the forget gate when acting on the candidate state. The idea being that this would make it easier for information to accumulate in the cell's memory. The JANET is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	s^{\langle t \rangle} &= W_f[c^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}] + b_f \label{eq:janet_in} \\
	\tilde{c}^{\langle t \rangle} &= \tanh(W_c[c^{\langle t-1 \rangle}, x^{\langle t \rangle}] + b_c) \label{eq:janet_cand} \\
	c^{\langle t \rangle} &= \sigma(s^{\langle t \rangle}) \odot c^{\langle t-1 \rangle} + (1 - \sigma(s^{\langle t \rangle} - \beta)) \odot \tilde{c}^{\langle t \rangle} \label{eq:janet_cell}
\end{align}
\end_inset

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 defines the 
\shape italic
input control component
\shape default
. This would usually be the argument of the sigmoid function in the forget gate. But the forget gate takes a slightly different form here, so it is easier to define the cell this way. Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:janet_cand"
plural "false"

 is the usual candidate definition. Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:janet_cell"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 defines the updated internal state. The first term of this equation is standard and controls how much the remembered state contributes to the updated state. The second term is standard except for the subtraction of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

. This subtraction reduces the contribution of the candidate state to the updated state, which helps the JANET's `memory' accumulate. In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the authors found that setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1$

 gave the best results on the tests performed. Similar to the GRU, the JANET uses the updated state

A skip connection in a recurrent neural network is an extra connection between two time steps a number of time steps apart. The normal connections in the RNN are still there. A dilated recurrent skip connection is a connection between steps in a recurrent neural network that skips one or more of the next steps without the normal one-step connections. A schematic diagram of a dilated skip connection can be seen in figure

 as compared to a standard skip connection. This has the effect of reducing the number of layers through which an error must be back propogated, which addresses the vanishing gradient problem, reduces the number of parameters in the network, and forces the network to learn some historical dependencies. The dilated skip connections also allow calculations to be performed in parallel, thereby exploiting the parallelising power of a GPU.

The residual network is motivated by the

degradation problem

, where an increase in the number of layers results in a disimprovement in both training and test error. Theoretically, if the added layers just learn the identity function there should be no degradation. This shows that some systems are more diffcult to optimise than others. The idea of the residual network is that it might be easier to optimise a network that learns residual functions instead of the usual output functions.

The AMI meeting corpus is a dataset of recordings of people meeting up and speaking English. The RNNs were trained to predict the next word for each speaker speaking at any given time. Both 3-layer and 10-layer networks were trained. The results of the AMI assessment for highway and residual LSTMs are shown in figure

. Both the training and cross-validation error for the 10-layer highway LSTM network are higher than that for the 3-layer. This indicates that the highway LSTM suffers from degredation. For the residual LSTM, although the training error is higher for the 10-layer network, the cross-validation error is lower for the deeper network. So the residual LTSM does not suffer from degredation. The higher training error for the deeper network could be due to better generalisation for data outside of the training set.

Holt-Winter's Decomposition Preprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RNNs require a large amount of data in order to be trained. This usually means that they are trained with time series from different contexts. As a result of this, RNN models tend to over-generalise and their forecasts are not time-series specific. One particular problem is that RNN models struggle with seasonality. Smyl et al (2018) deal with this problem by using an Holt-Winter's seasonal model decomposition (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:hw_seasonal"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) as a preprocessing step. For each time series in the M4 dataset, the level and seasonality are calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\ell_{t} &= \alpha \frac{y_t}{s_t} + (1 - \alpha)\ell_{t-1} \\
	s_{t+m} &= \gamma\frac{y_t}{l_t} + (1 - \gamma)s_t
\end{align}
\end_inset

then the forecasting equation is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\hat{y}_{t+1, \dots, t+h} = RNN(X_t)\odot \ell_t \odot s_{t+1, \dots, t+h}
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_t$
\end_inset

 is a vector of a normalised and deseasonlised time series features, usually the length of one season, and includes the origin of the series in a binary vector the length of the number of categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bear in mind that the parameters for the Holt-Winter's decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, are learned for each time series separately. The parameters in the RNN are learned for all of the time series together. Therefore the mode is hierarchical in nature, part of the model deals with the time series individually, and part of the model deals with all of the dataset as one.

where 
\begin_inset Formula $0 \leq Q \leq 1$
\end_inset

. If 
\begin_inset Formula $Q = 0.5$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $L_Q(y_t - \hat{y}_t)$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_1$
\end_inset

 loss function. If 
\begin_inset Formula $Q > 0.5$
\end_inset

 then errors where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_t \geq \hat{y}_t$
\end_inset

 will be penalised more heavily than errors where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_t \leq \hat{y}_t$
\end_inset

.

For the ES-RNN model, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q = 0.48$
\end_inset

. This value was chosen to counteract positive bias that the authors noticed while developing the model.

\begin_layout Standard
For assessing the quality of prediction intervals, the M4 competition used the 
\shape italic
Mean Scaled Interval Score
\shape default
, or MSIS, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	MSIS(U_t, L_t, Y_t, h, a) = \frac{1}{h}\frac{\sum_{t=1}^h (U_t - L_t) + \frac{2}{a}(L_t - Y_t)\mathbf{1}\{ Y_t < L_t \} + \frac{2}{a}(Y_t - U_t)\mathbf{1}\{ Y_t > U_t \}}{\frac{1}{n-m}\sum_{t=m+1}^n\modu{Y_t - Y_{t-m}}}
\end{align}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_t$
\end_inset

 is the estimate for the upper prediction interval, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_t$
\end_inset

 is the estimate for the lower prediction interval, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the horizon, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is a significance level ,and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
	\mathbf{1}\{ \text{\textbf{conditional}} \} = 	\begin{cases}
									1 &\quad \text{ if \textbf{conditional} is true} \\
									0 &\quad \text{ if \textbf{conditional} is false} \\
								\end{cases}
\end{align}
\end_inset

is called the 
\shape italic
indicator function
\shape default
. The ES-RNN model used the numerator of the MSIS function to train the model when forecasting prediction intervals.
